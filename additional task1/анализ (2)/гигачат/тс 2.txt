"hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( hlh ) secondary to infectious disease is an important entity especially in tropics where infectious diseases are rampant and still pose a major threat . a timely diagnosis and prompt treatment can improve the clinical outcome of this otherwise potentially fatal condition ! this request aims to alert the clinicians that in persistent unresolved fever especially in tropics , a diagnosis of secondary hlh should be given due consideration and we present 6 cases in this paper . all patients presented between march 2012 and march 2013 ( details shown in table 1 ) and fulfilled the revised criteria of hlh as listed in table 2 . of them , the mean age at diagnosis was 33.83 years ( range : 20 to 64 years ) , with a male : female ratio of 2:1 . three patients presented with evidence of hepatomegaly and\/or splenomegaly . all of the patients had at least a bi- or trilineage cytopenia , elevated liver enzymes and hyperferritinemia . two of the cases were secondary to dengue fever and one secondary to disseminated tuberculosis , one secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis , one secondary to malaria ( falciparum ) and one secondary to leptospirosis . all patients had good recovery and none of them relapsed at a median follow up of 4 months . characteristics of secondary hlh patients m  male ; f  female , y  yes ; n  no ; csa  cyclosporine ; na  not available proposed hlh diagnostic criteria , 2009 ravenous macrophage - hemophagocytosis of rbcs by macrophage seen hlh is a hyper - inflammatory condition which may be familial or occur secondary to autoimmune diseases or infection , malignancy or other triggers . despite advances in the diagnostic work up of febrile patients , hlh remains elusive from the diagnostic capabilities of many clinicians and continues to be a potentially fatal disease entity . the underlying pathophysiology of the disease constitutes an unrestrained immune activation with defective macrophage function regulation . an excessive activation of macrophages leads to a cytokine storm in the host and leads to host tissue damage and organ dysfunction associated with the syndrome . excessive pro - inflammatory or defective anti - inflammatory responses leading to this cytokine storm can be triggered by host factors or environmental agents . accordingly , a hlh arising in the setting of an underlying genetic mutation is termed familial hlh , in the setting of an underlying rheumatologic disease like rheumatoid arthritis is termed as macrophage activation syndrome ( mas ) and in the setting of an underlying infection it is termed as reactive or secondary hemophagocytic syndrome ( hps ) or secondary hlh . case reports describing mas post bone marrow transplant in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , or secondary to sle or dermatomyositis or other autoimmune diseases have been reported . macrophage and neutrophil activation is a hallmark in conditions like stills disease which can lead to hyperinflammatory condition with hlh . overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines , uncontrolled activation of t cells , and macrophages associated with decreased natural killer cell and cytotoxic cell functions seem to be the hallmarks of the immunologic abnormalities in mas . recent human and murine investigations suggest that all hpss should be differentiated based on etiology and pathogenesis as treatment strategies for each may vary . however , all etiologies lead to a state of hyper ferritin levels . the precise mechanism of ferritin as a trigger or a bystander in pathogenesis needs to be explored . the reactive or infection - associated hlh remains a relatively important and yet unfortunately an underdiagnosed entity especially in the tropical world . various combinations of high grade fever sometimes a second spike of fever after a brief period of recovery which coincides with fresh cytopenias , unresponsiveness to broad - spectrum antibiotics , new onset organomegaly or sudden increase in size of organomegaly in the setting of an infectious disease are some of the diagnostic clues for this disease . in case of infections , a simple blood investigation that shows elevated levels of serum ferritin should raise the suspicion of a coexisting hlh . a tentative diagnosis of hlh for initiation of immunosuppressive therapy can be done when clinical and lab abnormalities exist as defined in revised 2009 hlh protocol . also , in the resource poor settings , a single value of ferritin more than 10,000 in the absence of iron overload conditions like hemochromatosis and thalassemia syndromes can act as a surrogate marker for hlh with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 96% . hps secondary to infections has been classified as a separate entity under international classification of diseases by world health organization . other viruses like dengue , herpes , cmv , hiv have been reported to have hps secondary to them . secondary hps has frequently been associated with intracellular pathogens that stimulate th1 immune response . of the bacterial infections , other reports with organisms like salmonella , leptospirosis , malaria , toxoplasmosis , leishmenia , rickettsia and other organisms have been postulated in secondary hlh . although case reports and case series have frequently reported the reactive hlh secondary to infectious causes especially in the tropical countries , it continues to remain as an under diagnosed and under - reported entity . the treatment of secondary hlh includes aggressive treatment of underlying condition along with immunosuppressive therapy . however , recent data suggest to a less intense immunosuppressive therapy . as opposed to the familial hlh , where allogenic stem cell transplant is the only curative treatment , most of the infection associated hlh cases respond to a course of corticosteroids . some patients may need additional treatment with drugs like etoposide and cyclosporine ; however , a full course of hlh 2004 protocol is rarely required in them . in our case series , all patients were initiated with dexamethasone at a dose of 10 mg \/ m \/ day . three patients with hlh secondary to underlying tuberculosis , malaria and leptospirosis [ case 2 , 5 , 6 in table 1 ] each responded to steroid monotherapy . within 2 days of starting steroids their fever reduced with improvement in cytopenias . one patient with dengue fever had a ferritin values more than 100,000 along with severe pancytopenia . she was given two doses of etoposide iv at a dose of 100 mg \/ m ( reduced dose ) at weekly intervals . other two patients were given one single dose of etoposide following which they became symptomatically better . one patient with dengue and one with tuberculosis however had delayed recovery of platelet count and they were started on oral cyclosporine . csa was given for duration of three months following which it was tapered and stopped . this is in tune with the other case reports and case series of secondary hlh . one possible explanation for this is removal of inciting agent by means of effective antibacterial therapy . because of its powerful proapoptotic activity describe their unique experience with stem cell transplant in treating secondary hlh in an adolescent . srinivas et al . in their systemic review of hemophagocytosis syndrome ( hps ) in tropics found infectious trigger as the cause in 51% of the adult patients . leishmenia was seen in 40.6% , rickettsia in 18.8% malaria in 15.6% and enteric fever in 9.4% . 56% patients were secondary to viruses , 26% secondary to dengue virus , 17.3% were secondary to ebv and 8.7% each to cmv and parvovirus b 19 . most of the literature on hlh in tropics is centered on few hospitals and includes case reports and case series . larger studies and trials are required to throw more light on this potentially fatal condition and unfold the mysteries of ravenous macrophages . in india , hlh associated with dengue fever and malaria with a high parasite index has been documented . in one study from india , the dengue virus has been found to be the most common agent causing hlh in children . many of the previous case reports of hlh are reported in complicated dengue fever like dengue hemorrhagic syndrome . crohn 's disease and immunosuppression are associated with an increased risk for developing secondary hlh , although none of our patients had underlying disease or immunosuppressed status .. however , cases with classical dengue syndrome have also been reported from indian subcontinent . in our series also , we report two cases of classical dengue fever with secondary hlh . our cases add to the existing literature of handful of cases of hlh in dengue . although more common in tropics a case of elderly female has been described by cdc , usa in which hlh secondary to possible dengue infection proved fatal and physicians in west need to be alerted about possible travel acquired dengue which can have fatal complications like secondary hlh . describe the time - lines of six cases of confirmed dengue with varying severities of hemophagocytosis . both our patients presented with fever , pancytopenia , organomegaly , high ferritin and fulfilled the criteria of hlh and responded to corticosteroids and etoposide . hlh secondary to malaria was reported in a young man ( case number 5 ) who had persistent fever , falling counts despite treatment with antimalarials . had described one of the first cases of hemophagocytosis secondary to malaria ( falciparum ) which resolved with antimalarials . park et al . discusses four case reports of hlh secondary to vivax malaria all of which resolved with antimalarials . however , studies in the pediatric population show degree of parasitemia is associated with severity of disease . similarly our case was secondary to p falciparum malaria with severe parasitemia seen on peripheral smear . the patient responded to corticosteroids .. hlh secondary to disseminated tuberculosis has been described in past . pristilla et al . in their review analyzed 36 cases of tuberculosis with secondary hlh . they found fever to be the most common presenting symptom and evidence of extra - pulmonary tuberculosis was found in 83% of cases . in our series , case number 2 a young boy with fever , weight loss , military tuberculosis and choroid tubercles was diagnosed as a case of disseminated tuberculosis . no significant improvement with anti tubercular treatment prompted us to look for other causes and was diagnosed as secondary hlh based on clinical features , high ferritin and bone marrow evidence of hemophagocytosis . steroids were added to his treatment course and he showed significant improvement within 2 weeks . similarly an elderly female was diagnosed to have hlh secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and was started on steroids . however , she did not improve and was further treated with iv etoposide and oral cyclosporine and showed complete remission of symptoms and evidence of hemophagocytosis on follow up after 4 week . this is consistent with earlier studies which showed negative tuberculin test should never preclude the possibility of overwhelming tubercular infection in hlh . leptospirosis is a spirochete which is commonly prevalent in coastal belt of south india . to the best of our knowledge , no case of hlh secondary to this disease in adult has been reported . the diagnostic challenge in making appropriate diagnosis has been discussed in one of the previous case reports from taiwan in a young male who presented with shock and had evidence of reactive hemophagocytosis . our patient was a fisherman from the endemic area who presented with fever and oliguria . in due course he developed hepatosplenomegaly , severe cytopenia , esr of 5 , high ferritin and bone marrow evidence of hemophagocytosis . in conclusion with limited experience and lack of guidelines for treatment of tropical hlh , a high index of suspicion is something clinicians should bear in mind .","response":"hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( hlh ) is a potentially fatal hyper inflammatory condition , if not recognized and treated in time . \n a high index of suspicion can help identify the condition early . \n this condition can occur in the primary or secondary form . \n secondary hlh or hemophagocytic syndrome ( hps ) secondary to infections is an important clinical entity especially in tropical world . in this request \n , we share our experience with this entity and make an attempt to explore literature about ravenous macrophages which occurs secondary to infections . \n it is a series of six cases of hlh secondary to infectious disease in our center in a coastal city in south india over last one year with follow up ."}
{"request":"the management of patients with coagulopathic disorders undergoing orthopaedic surgery requires a dedicated , multi - disciplinary team with detailed perioperative planning . bernard - soulier syndrome ( bss ) is an extremely rare disorder , affecting 1 in 1 million individuals worldwide . it is caused by a deficiency in glycoprotein 1b - v - ix which is required for normal platelet - mediated clot formation . a 40 year old , female with known bss and developmental dysplasia of her left hip ( ddh ) was referred to us for consideration of left total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) . consultation with her haematologist for pre - operative optimization of platelets and related clotting times together with detailed discussions of her intended anaesthesia protocol and surgery resulted in a successful operation with less than anticipated blood loss . bss is an extremely rare bleeding disorder that puts patients at very high risk of blood loss following surgery . this is the first report that we are aware of describing a bss patient undergoing a tha . a cohesive , highly specialized , multi - disciplinary team is crucial to the success of these patients . bernard - soulier syndrome ( bss ) is a rare , inheritable ( autosomal recessive ) platelet disorder affecting an estimated 1 in every 1 million individuals . a mutation involving glycoprotein complex 1b - v - ix renders platelets unable to bind von willebrand factor ( vwf ) and form clots . bss patients require rigorous perioperative planning , however , the literature is devoid of reports describing bss patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery . we present a young female patient with bss that underwent total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) for her dysplastic left hip . a 40 year old , 83 kg female with developmental dysplasia of her left hip ( ddh ) was referred to us for consideration of left tha having suffered increasing left hip pain over the past three years . her diagnosis of ddh was not made until adulthood despite her left leg being shorter than her right leg by 2.5 cm . she was diagnosed with bss at the age of 18 , and her haematology reports confirm 2 prior hospital admissions related to delayed bleeding following wisdom- teeth extraction at the age of 20 and cervical cone biopsy ; the latter of which required transfusion with platelets and packed red blood cells ( prbc ) . prior to this , she had been taking birth control pills from the age 14 for heavy menstruation . pre - operative cross - match and group and screen of blood was conducted confirming blood type a+ . blood work also confirmed that she was not factor xiii deficit as initially suspected ( fxiii activity , 1.04 u \/ ml ) . her glycoprotein 1b level was 15% with an estimated platelet count of 12 ( x109\/l ) and inr 0.9 . we consulted our thrombosis , haemophilia and internal medicine teams for pre - operative optimization . having a clinical nurse specialist tranexamic acid ( ta ) 1 g po tid was initiated 24 hours prior to surgery and continued until 14 days post - operatively . 20 mcg of ddavp ( desmopressin ) diluted into 50 ml of normal saline was given intravenously over a period of 30 minutes , 1 hour prior to surgery . immediately following this , she received 1 adult dose ( 4 units\/318 ml ) of pooled , buffy - coat platelets which elevated her platelets to 79 ( x109\/l ) along with 1 unit of prbc to bring her haemoglobin ( hb ) to 135 ( table 1 ) . intravenous antibiotics ( ancef , 2 g ) were given within 30 minutes of surgery . induction of general anaesthesia was conducted using a mixture of intravenous propofol ( 170 mg ) , sufentanil ( 20 mcg ) , versed ( 2 mg ) and rocuronium ( 50 mcg ) . a glidescope ( verathon inc . , anaesthesia maintenance comprised isoflurane ( 1.8% ) with 58% o2 at 1.2l \/ min and air at 1.3l \/ min . once sedate , our patient was positioned in a standard right lateral decubitus position , supported by a stulberg frame ( innomed inc . , particular attention was taken to avoid undue tension through soft tissues during dislocation of the hip . similarly , bone bleeding following transection of the femoral neck and reaming of the acetabulum and femoral canal was addressed immediately . , ny , usa , 2 g in 10 ml sterile normal saline ) was packed into the femoral canal and acetabulum for a period of 3 - 4 minutes prior to placement of implants . the femoral component ( accolade ii ; stryker canada , hamilton , on , ca ) was impacted into the femoral canal in the typical fashion . to optimize functional range , we used an anatomic dual mobility ( adm ) , bearing hip system from stryker ( fig 1 ) . bleeding was minimal following impaction of either the femoral or acetabular prostheses . muscle and surrounding fascial layers were infiltrated with 0.5% marcaine \/ epinephrine ( 1:1000 ; 40 ml ) . the incision was meticulously closed in multiple layers followed by steri- strips and mepore dressings . pre- ( a ) and post- ( b ) operative radiographs showing the new implant . post - operatively , daily transfusions of platelets were given up to post - operative day ( pod ) 14 . transfusions comprised 2 single donor ( 232 ml ) , 4 plateletpharesis ( 208 44 ml ) and 8 pooled , buffy coated platelets ( 345 15ml ) . platelet counts dropped by 40% post - operatively but recovered by pod 6 ( see table 1 ) . serum sodium levels remained stable ; the lowest reading was 128 mmol \/ l on pod 2 , recovering to 136 mmol \/ l by pod 6 . systolic blood pressures were also stable at 103 14 mmhg , the lowest ( 98\/59 ) occurring pod 1 . her blood work was recorded daily , a summary of which is shown in table 1 . her pain was controlled effectively with oral hydromorphone contin ( 6 mg , bid ) and tylenol ( 975 mg , q4h ) . patient entered into rehabilitation pod 7 and was discharged home on pod 19 following complete review by our haematology and medicine teams . pre - operative blood work results ; estimated counts ; hb : haemoglobin ; hct : haematocrit . the overall leg length discrepancy was improved from 2.5 cm to 1 cm without the need for additional soft tissue release . bernard - soulier syndrome , first described in 1948 , is an inheritable bleeding disorder affecting 1:1,000,000 individuals [ 1 - 3 ] . patients have prolonged bleeding times and are at high risk for spontaneous bleeding with the membrane - bound glycoprotein 1b \/ v \/ ix found on platelets have been described to explain this phenomenon . transfusions of allogeneic platelets remain the definitive treatment for patients with bss although intravenous injection of recombinant activated factor vii ( rfviia ) is also effective . the potential for developing anti - platelet antibodies with repeat platelet transfusions remains true although mansour et al suggest that this risk may be lessened for patients with bss since the 1b \/ v \/ ix complex is not associated with a platelet - specific antigen site . total hip arthroplasty is a major surgery with significant risks of blood loss , deep vein thromboembolism ( dvt ) , pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and infection . estimates of blood loss following tha in patient without a bleeding disorder vary considerably within the literature ; from 300 - 1500 ml with 20 - 30% risk of dvt or pe [ 5 - 7 ] . tranexamic acid ( ta ) is an anti - fribinolytic that inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin with an established role in joint arthroplasty and good evidence to support reduced blood loss with no increased risk of dvt or pe . we provided oral ta peri - operatively and topical ta through the open wound intra - operatively with doses equivalent to 12 mg \/ kg po tid and 24 mg \/ kg respectively . a prospective randomized control trial using topical ta ( 2g\/100 ml 0.9% saline ) ddavp binds v2 receptors found on endothelial cells to increase vwf release and promote factor viii . we saw a slight drop over the peri - operative period , however values quickly corrected after the ddavp was stopped . importantly , the inhibitory effect of propofol on platelets is not evident at clinically relevant doses and its ease of induction outweighs this theoretical risk . epidural or lumbar spine blocks and\/or controlled hypotension can also reduce potential blood loss by 30 - 50% . nevertheless , the potential risk for bleeding in and around the spinal cord can not not be ignored . we strived for a systolic blood pressure of 100 mmhg intra- operatively and our total intra - operative blood loss was comparable to what we expect in patients without bss . furthermore , we only used 1l of 0.9% saline intra - operatively so avoided haemodilution which could potentially exacerbate our existing coagulopathy . we experienced no adverse transfusions reactions despite multiple platelet transfusions post - operatively and hb remained stable . we avoided use of non - steroidal anti - inflammatories which are known to increase peri - operative blood loss following tha . similarly , conservative use of narcotics is warranted to avoid extreme hypotensive episodes . we found long acting hydromorphone with extra - strength tylenol to be most effective for pain control allowing the patient to mobilize quickly after surgery . we made no special concessions regarding the patient s ddh other than use of the adm implant and minimal acetabular reaming . this is the first report of a successful tha on a young adult with bernard - soulier syndrome . strict intra - operative haemostasis with limited soft tissue perturbation , limited reaming of the acetabulum and tight , multi - layered closure are instrumental to limit blood loss . the utility of anti - fibrinolytics and ddavp in bss patients is clearly borne out in this study . the management of coagulopathic patients in orthopaedics is a very specialized area of medicine requiring an in depth understanding of the risks of the surgery inherent to these patients . specific algorithms continue to be refined with regards to the use of perioperative agents to minimize intraoperative blood loss just as surgical technique and technology continues to evolve to minimize perturbation of soft tissues and converse bone and in doing so limit the need for postoperative transfusion ."
